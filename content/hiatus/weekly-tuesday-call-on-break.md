Our weekly Tuesday call (8AM PT) is on a break during July and August 2024. We'll be back on 3rd of September at 8 AM using the same existing [recurrent invite](https://aka.ms/community/ms-speakers-call-invite).

**Other community calls are continuing normally without breaks during this time**. You can see and download recurrent invites to all calls from https://aka.ms/community/calls

All calls are being recorded and published within our [YouTube channel](https://aka.ms/community/youtube) where you'll find new content each and every business day. Subscribe today!
