The community team, comprising both Microsoft employees and community members, is dedicated to enhancing the use of Microsoft products. By providing guidance, tools, solutions, and samples, we aim to improve both the community and the solutions it creates.

This initiative focuses on the collective benefit, not just individual contributors. The listed team members are coordinators who facilitate our efforts, but they represent only a fraction of those contributing.

We deeply appreciate the efforts of all community members.
